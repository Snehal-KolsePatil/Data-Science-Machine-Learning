# Academic-Performance-Predictor(By using Machine Learning)
## Project Objective:
The Academic Performance Predictor project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict students' academic outcomes based on Data. By identifying patterns and key influencers of performance, the model seeks to assist educators and institutions in making data-driven decisions to enhance learning outcomes and provide targeted support to students.

## Technologies Used:

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook 

## Workflow:

- Load and clean the dataset
- Perform EDA to uncover trends
- Split data into training and test sets
- Train machine learning models 
- Evaluate and compare model performance
